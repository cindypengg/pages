        <h2>What is a website?</h2>
        <p style="color: hotpink;">For the past handful of years, I’ve been teaching courses about interactive design and
            the internet.<br>
            <h3>I teach within art departments at universities, so we learn about the internet’s impact on art—and vice
                versa—and how technological advance often coincides with artistic development.<br>
                In class, we make websites. To do this, we learn the elemental markup and code languages of the web—HTML, CSS,
                and some JavaScript.</h3></p>

        However, sometimes after the semester is over, I receive perplexing emails from students asking, “So how do I
        actually make a website?”<br>
        This sparked my own questioning. “What is a website, anyway?” It’s easy to forget. Today there are millions of ways
        to make a website, and the abundance is daunting. But at its core, a website is still the same as ever before:<br>
        A website is a file or bundle of files living on a server somewhere. A server is a computer that’s always connected
        to the internet, so that when someone types your URL in, the server will offer up your website. Usually you have to
        pay for a server. You also have to pay for a domain name, which is an understandable piece of language that points
        to an IP. An IP is a string of numbers that is an address to your server.<br>
        Links (rendered default blue and underlined—they’re the hypertext “HT” in HTML) are the oxygen of the web. Not all
        websites have links, but all links connect to other webpages, within the same site or elsewhere.<br>
        But my students already know this! So when they ask me about actually making a website, they are referring to a
        website in the world … today.<br>
        <p class="box" style="color: brown;"> fffjffjff</p>
        <p style="color:brown" class="highlighted">
            It’s healthy to acknowledge today’s web is much different than the web many of us grew up using. So when they
            ask how to make a website (despite having already “learned”), they are alluding to the technological friction
            and social pressures that often come along with creating and maintaining a website in 2018.<br>
            Although they may seem initially accommodating and convenient to their users, universally popular social media
            sites—like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Pinterest—are private companies that prioritize advertising above
            their users’ needs. Their users’ happiness is not the primary focus, so it’s perfectly normal for you to feel
            anxiety when using or even thinking about social media. In this age of digital cacophony dominated by these
            platforms, no one is looking out for you… but you. It makes perfect sense, then, when individuals tell me they
            want their website to do the job of “setting the record straight” on who they are and what they do.<br>
            However, clarity is one of many possible intentions for a website. There are other legitimate states of mind
            capable of communication—a surprising, memorable, monumental, soothing, shocking, unpredictable, radically
            boring, bizarre, mind-blowing, very quiet and subtle, and/or amazing website could work. You also need not limit
            yourself to only one website—as perhaps you’d like to confuse or surprise with multiple.<br>
            My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: they’re both subject and object at once. In other words, a
            website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously. There are endless possibilities as to what a
            website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden?
            A puddle? Whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a
            website, in turn the website helps form your own identity.<br>
            Why have a website?<br>
        </p>
        <p style="color:blueviolet">
            Today more than ever, we need individuals rather than corporations to guide the web’s future. The web is called
            the web because its vitality depends on just that—an interconnected web of individual nodes breathing life into
            a vast network. This web needs to actually work for people instead of being powered by a small handful of big
            corporations—like Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google.<br>
            Individuals can steer the web back to its original architecture simply by having a website. I think artists, in
            particular, could be instrumental in this space—showing the world where the web can go.<br>
        <p class="highlighted">Artists excel at creating worlds. They do this first for themselves and then, when they share
            their work, for others. Of course, world-building means creating everything—not only making things inside the
            world but also the surrounding world itself—the language, style, rules, and architecture.<br></p>
        This is why websites are so important. They allow the author to create not only works (the “objects”) but also the
        world (the rooms, the arrangement of rooms, the architecture!). Ideally, the two would inform each other in a
        virtuous, self-perfecting loop. This can be incredibly nurturing to an artist’s practice.<br>
        To those creative people who say “I don’t need a website,” I ask: why not have a personal website that works
        strategically, in parallel to your other activities? How could a website complement what you already do rather than
        competing or repeating? How can you make it fun or thought-provoking or (insert desired feeling here) for you? How
        can the process of making and cultivating a website contribute to your approach?<br>
        A website can be anything. It doesn’t (and probably shouldn’t) be an archive of your complete works. That’s going to
        be dead the moment you publish. A website, or anything interactive, is inherently unfinished. It’s imperfect—maybe
        sometimes it even has a few bugs. But that’s the beauty of it. Websites are living, temporal spaces. What happens to
        websites after death, anyway?<br>
        </p>
        <p id="what-is-a-website">What can a website be?<br></p>
        
        Website as room<br>
        In an age of information overload, a room is comforting because it’s finite, often with a specific intended purpose.
